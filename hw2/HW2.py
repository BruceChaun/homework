# ## Introduction
# 
# This assignment will review the two classic methods for solving Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with finite state and action spaces.
# We will implement value iteration (VI) and policy iteration (PI) for a finite MDP, both of which find the optimal policy in a finite number of iterations.
# 
# The experiments here will use the Frozen Lake environment, a simple gridworld MDP that is taken from `gym` and slightly modified for this assignment. In this MDP, the agent must navigate from the start state to the goal state on a 4x4 grid, with stochastic transitions.

# In[2]:

from frozen_lake import FrozenLakeEnv
env = FrozenLakeEnv()
print(env.__doc__)


# Let's look at what a random episode looks like.

# In[2]:

# Some basic imports and setup
import numpy as np, numpy.random as nr, gym
np.set_printoptions(precision=3)
def begin_grading(): print("\x1b[43m")
def end_grading(): print("\x1b[0m")

# Seed RNGs so you get the same printouts as me
env.seed(0); from gym.spaces import prng; prng.seed(10)
# Generate the episode
env.reset()
for t in range(100):
    env.render()
    a = env.action_space.sample()
    ob, rew, done, _ = env.step(a)
    if done:
        break
assert done
env.render();


# In the episodeÂ above, the agent falls into a hole after two timesteps. Also note the stochasticity--on the first step, the DOWN action is selected, but the agent moves to the right.
# 
# We extract the relevant information from the gym Env into the MDP class below.
# The `env` object won't be used any further, we'll just use the `mdp` object.

# In[3]:

    def __init__(self, P, nS, nA, desc=None):
        self.P = P # state transition and reward probabilities, explained below
        self.nS = nS # number of states
        self.nA = nA # number of actions
        self.desc = desc # 2D array specifying what each grid cell means (used for plotting)

print("mdp.P is a two-level dict where the first key is the state and the second key is the action.")
print("The 2D grid cells are associated with indices [0, 1, 2, ..., 15] from left to right and top to down, as in")
print(np.arange(16).reshape(4,4))
print("mdp.P[state][action] is a list of tuples (probability, nextstate, reward).\n")
print("For example, state 0 is the initial state, and the transition information for s=0, a=0 is \nP[0][0] =", mdp.P[0][0], "\n")
print("As another example, state 5 corresponds to a hole in the ice, which transitions to itself with probability 1 and reward 0.")

# ## Part 1: Value Iteration

# ### Problem 1: implement value iteration
# In this problem, you'll implement value iteration, which has the following pseudocode:
# 
# ---
# Initialize $V^{(0)}(s)=0$, for all $s$
# 
# For $i=0, 1, 2, \dots$
# - $V^{(i+1)}(s) = \max_a \sum_{s'} P(s,a,s') [ R(s,a,s') + \gamma V^{(i)}(s')]$, for all $s$
# 
# ---
# 
# We additionally define the sequence of greedy policies $\pi^{(0)}, \pi^{(1)}, \dots, \pi^{(n-1)}$, where
# $$\pi^{(i)}(s) = \arg \max_a \sum_{s'} P(s,a,s') [ R(s,a,s') + \gamma V^{(i)}(s')]$$
# 
# Your code will return two lists: $[V^{(0)}, V^{(1)}, \dots, V^{(n)}]$ and $[\pi^{(0)}, \pi^{(1)}, \dots, \pi^{(n-1)}]$
# 
# To ensure that you get the same policies as the reference solution, choose the lower-index action to break ties in $\arg \max_a$. This is done automatically by np.argmax. This will only affect the "# chg actions" printout below--it won't affect the values computed.
# 
# <div class="alert alert-warning">
# Warning: make a copy of your value function each iteration and use that copy for the update--don't update your value function in place. 
# Updating in-place is also a valid algorithm, sometimes called Gauss-Seidel value iteration or asynchronous value iteration, but it will cause you to get different results than me.

# 
# When we ran value iteration on the frozen lake problem, the last iteration where an action changed was iteration 6--i.e., value iteration computed the optimal policy at iteration 6.
# Are there any guarantees regarding how many iterations it'll take value iteration to compute the optimal policy?
# There are no such guarantees without additional assumptions--we can construct the MDP in such a way that the greedy policy will change after arbitrarily many iterations.
# 
# Your task: define an MDP with at most 3 states and 2 actions, such that when you run value iteration, the optimal action changes at iteration >= 50. Use discount=0.95. (However, note that the discount doesn't matter here--you can construct an appropriate MDP with any discount.)

# ## Problem 3: Policy Iteration
# 
# The next task is to implement exact policy iteration (PI), which has the following pseudocode:
# 
# ---
# Initialize $\pi_0$
# 
# For $n=0, 1, 2, \dots$
# - Compute the state-value function $V^{\pi_{n}}$
# - Using $V^{\pi_{n}}$, compute the state-action-value function $Q^{\pi_{n}}$
# - Compute new policy $\pi_{n+1}(s) = \operatorname*{argmax}_a Q^{\pi_{n}}(s,a)$
# ---
# 
# Below, you'll implement the first and second steps of the loop.
# 
# ### Problem 3a: state value function
# 
# You'll write a function called `compute_vpi` that computes the state-value function $V^{\pi}$ for an arbitrary policy $\pi$.
# Recall that $V^{\pi}$ satisfies the following linear equation:
# $$V^{\pi}(s) = \sum_{s'} P(s,\pi(s),s')[ R(s,\pi(s),s') + \gamma V^{\pi}(s')]$$
# You'll have to solve a linear system in your code. (Find an exact solution, e.g., with `np.linalg.solve`.)
